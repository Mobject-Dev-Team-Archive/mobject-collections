## The mobject-collections Library

This is one of the many libraries of [mobject](http://mobject.org). This library focuses on dynamic collections.

## What is mobject?

Pronounced mob-ject.

A sprinkling of OOP is usually enough to simplify and unclutter procedural code. However, the more you apply OOP, the more you find the need to expand it's scope to accommodate functionality which is missing from the language. Hence, mobject was conceived. It's a framework, library and mindset of how problems such as this can be resolved using both pre-written code and examples.

mobject's goal is to be a lightweight solution to typical oop problems.
